      <h1> Responsibilities for nurses</h1>
      <h2>1.Record medical history and symptoms</h2>
      <p>Nurses record and maintain accurate documentation of their patients' health to ensure they receive the proper treatment. Most nurses begin this process by asking patients questions about their medical history to gather information about previous diagnoses and surgeries, current medications, allergies and relevant family medical information. They may also ask the patient questions about any symptoms they are currently experiencing and record their vitals.
         If the patient receives a new diagnosis, medication or treatment plan during their visit, a nurse may be responsible for updating their medical record with this information. Maintaining detailed and accurate medical records is critical for ensuring patients receive the best possible care.</p>
      <h2>2. Administer medications and treatments</h2>
      <p>Most nurses can administer medications and treatments to their patients with a physician's order. They can also help develop a treatment plan for their patients. Specialized nurses, such as nurse practitioners, may be able to prescribe medications without a doctor's approval. Some treatments nurses may help with include cleaning and dressing wounds, changing bandages and inserting catheters. Nurses may also assist doctors with more advanced procedures or administer emergency care to patients in critical condition.</p>
      <h2>3. Collaborate with teams for patient care</h2>     
      <p>Nurses play a vital role in collecting information from patients and sharing it with the rest of their medical team. Because this is such a key responsibility for those in the nursing profession, nurses must have excellent verbal and written communication skills to effectively collaborate with physicians and other healthcare providers. Clear, concise communication can also ensure that patients and their family members understand all of the information they receive.</p>
      <h2>4. Perform diagnostic tests</h2>
      <p>Nurses may perform a wide variety of diagnostic tests, including checking vitals and collecting tissue, blood, stool or urine samples for analysis. It is important for nurses to pay close attention to detail to ensure these tests are administered properly because they need this information to diagnose patients and develop treatment plans. Nurses may also be responsible for analyzing the results and sharing what they find with the rest of their medical team.</p>
      <h2>5. Conduct physical examinations</h2>
      <p>Nurses often conduct a physical examination of patients at the beginning of their visit to assess their overall health. This may involve taking the patient's temperature, recording their weight, monitoring their heartbeat and checking their blood pressure. This examination may also include testing the patient's reflexes, checking their lymph nodes and examining their eyes, ears, nose and throat. The physical examination provides nurses and the rest of the medical team with a current update on the patient's health and an opportunity to talk to patients about their health goals and concerns.</p>
      <h1>Nurses' Roles and Responsibilities in Providing Care and Support at the End of Life</h1>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this ANA position statement is to articulate the roles, responsibilities, and opportunities for nurses providing care for patients at the end of their lives, and for their families. This statement also provides direction for nurses to support patients and families in recognizing and adapting to a patient’s impending death. Nurses are responsible for recognizing patients’ symptoms, taking measures within their scope of practice to administer medications, providing other measures for symptom alleviation, and collaborating with other professionals to optimize patients’ comfort and families’ understanding and adaptation.        
      </p>
      <h2>Statement of ANA Position</h2>
      <p>Nurses are obliged to provide comprehensive and compassionate end-of-life care. This includes recognizing when death is near and conveying that information to families. Nurses should collaborate with other members of the health care team to ensure optimal symptom management and to provide support for the patient and family. Nurses and other health care providers have a responsibility to establish decision-making processes that reflect physiologic realities, patient preferences, and the recognition of what, clinically, may or may not be accomplished. Establishing goals of care for this patient at this time may provide a framework for discussion about what care should be provided. This process often involves collaboration with experts in decision-making, such as ethics committees or palliative care teams.</p>
    <h1>Leadership in Nursing: Qualities & Why It Matters</h1>
    <h2>Qualities & Leadership Styles</h2>
    <p>Strong leaders in nursing are vital to help navigate the constant evolution of health care. Nurse leaders do more than balance costs, monitor productivity, and maintain patient and staff satisfaction. They serve as role models and influence health care organizations at all levels. A strong nurse leader motivates their colleagues, setting the tone for a safe, civil workplace with a culture of high morale and job retention.</p>
